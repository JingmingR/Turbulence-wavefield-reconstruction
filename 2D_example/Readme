Document desctrpition:

All notebooks in this folder are related to 2D reconstruction.

Curve-focus_sampling.ipynb: corresponds to the partitioned sampling case in the report. densely-sampled at the apexes, sparsely sampled at both flanks.

example.ipynb: an basic example for regular subsampling.

Masks.ipynb: using masks in space-time domain and in Fourier domain to reconstruct over-subsampled data.

Partioning.ipynb: an extension from Curve-focus_sampling.ipynb, solving left flank and right flank separatly.

GulfOfSuez128.mat: an example of 2D sediment seismic dataset.

Radon.py: a small try to use radon transform (failed).
